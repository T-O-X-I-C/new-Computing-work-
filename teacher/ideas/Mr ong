Mr Ong

He is a kind and helpful teacher.</br>
He will try to make his lesson fun and engaging by cracking science jokes and having more practicals. </br>
I kinda like him but sadly,</br> 
he left in July to take part in a teaching course.</br>
I hope that he will be my science teacher again next year.</br>
